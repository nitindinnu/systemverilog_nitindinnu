# Questions Practical
1. [write a code by taking variable s1,s2,s3,s4,s5 of size [4:0].Use constraint so that in each repetion the values of s1,s2,s3,s4,s5 should not be the same.Repeat 15 times](01.sv)
2. [Write code show the importance of using "soft keyword.](02.sv)
3. [write a code to show enabling_disabling of constraint](03.sv)
4. [Write A module code with functions each with two arguments. Inside first function do addition operation and return output and display 2 similarly in second function do subtraction and 5' third function do multiplication](04.sv)
5. [Write transaction and generator class for flla adder. Create a toP module and execute](05.sv)
