- Encapsulation in Systemverilog (SV) is the technique of hiding data within the class and making
- it available only through the methods.
- It is an act of enclosing class members (properties/methods) from being accessed outside of SV,
- and by default members are public,
- so it can be accessible outside of SV directly using class handle and dot operator.
