There are virtual methods (functions/tasks) and pure virtual methods and then there is virtual class (also known as abstract class)

- A **virtual function/task is a method** that can be inherited in derived class and the behavior over ridden.
- A **virtual class (or abstract class) is a class** defined with an intention to be only a base class or prototype class. The actual implementation of methods/behavior would needs to be done in one or several derived classes.
- A **pure virtual function/task is a virtual method** declared in an abstract class to make sure that a derived class implements the same mandatory. These are mentioned as pure as a implementation would differ based on derived classes but are a must
